# `primo-explore-help-menu` [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/primo-explore-help-menu.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/primo-explore-help-menu)

Add link to customizable 'help-menu' popup to `prm-search-bookmark-filter-after` (top nav bar)

## Description

![help-menu dialog](https://github.com/bulib/primo-explore-bu/blob/master/packages/help-menu/img/help-menu-preview.gif?raw=true)

1. clicking on the '(?)' icon in the top right of any page brings up a new help-menu dialog
2. here, users see a list of entries (from `list_of_elements`) which they can scroll through and select
3. once selected, the user sees the specified `template` for that entry displayed
4. links can be made between entries very simply using anchor tags `#{entry.id}`
5. if desired, users can open the help menu in a new window to enable multi-tasking

_note: as of `1.3.0`, you can open the help menu from any page (or module) by triggering an `openHelpMenuEvent` event!_

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('openHelpMenuEvent'))
```

_If you want to specify a particular page, simply add the entry `id` as the event `detail` like so:_

```javascript
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('openHelpMenuEvent', {detail:'getting-started'}))
```

## Usage

### Adding the Package to your view in `primo-explore`

run the following command from within your view's main directory to add it as a dependency.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev primo-explore-help-menu
```

this should add the following line to your `package.json` file...
```json
"primo-explore-help-menu": "^1.X.X"
```

and add the contents of this repository (at that npm version) into a `node_modules/primo-explore-help-menu`
  directory for your current view. the presence of this package should mean that the package was successfully
  installed and added to your project.

### Installing/Importing it

from here you'll have to edit your `main.js` (or `config.module.js`) file to `import` the package, and add
   _both_ `'helpMenuContentDisplay'` and `'helpMenuTopbar'`, to the dependencies inside of your
   `'viewCustom'` module:

```js
import 'primo-explore-help-menu';  // import './help-menu.js'

angular.module('viewCustom', ['angularLoad', 'helpMenuContentDisplay',  'helpMenuTopbar'])
```

(see `./src/.main.js` for a working example).

### Additional Steps

To get the same styling, you'll have to copy or import the `help-menu.css` file to the `css/custom.css` for your view.
  to automate this, add the following `script` to your `package.json`:

```json
  "postinstall": "cp node_modules/primo-explore-help-menu/dist/help-menu.css ./css/help-menu.css"
```
  
If you're using a version from `1.1.0` onward, you'll have to make sure there's a `html/help_en_US.html` included as well

```bash
$ touch html/help_en_US.html
```

### Adding Your Own Content

To add your own content, specify a `list_of_elements` variable within a `constant` object called `'helpMenuConfig'` and
  attach it to your primo angular module (`app`) like so:

```js
// main.js
import {my_custom_list_of_elements} from 'my_long_list_of_json_objects';

app.constant('helpMenuConfig', { "list_of_elements": my_custom_list_of_elements });
```

Make sure that each object in the list of elements matches the following structure:
```json
{
  "id":"my-custom-help-entry",
  "title":"My Custom Help Entry",
  "icon":{"group":"action", "code":"description"},
  "description":"brief description of the entry's purpose (optional)",
  "template":"<h3>A valid Heading</h3><p>relevant information below that heading</p>"
}
```

...include intentionally empty objects in the list (`{}`) to form the dividers.

_note: the [iconset being used](https://material.io/tools/icons/) is from material.io and is included within primo_

As of `1.6.0`, you can also specify a `list_of_updates` variable with the same structure to highlight a number of
  items above the other entries. At BU, we use this feature to highlight recent changes to the platform or big 
  pieces of library news.

```js
// main.js
import {my_custom_list_of_updates} from 'my_long_list_of_json_objects';

app.constant('helpMenuConfig', { "list_of_updates": my_custom_list_of_updates });
```

### Additional Customization

the following table describes describes some additional configuration options that are currently afforded to
  you by the package. an example implementation of this section can be found within this repo at `src/.main.js`:

|name|default|description|
|:------|:-----|:----------|
|`logToConsole`|`true`|controls whether or not messages about what's going on in the component are `console.log()`-ed (visible in inspector)|
|`publishEvents`|`false`|controls whether the `logEventToAnalytics` is actually triggered, ensurng only real traffic is tracked|
|`logEventToAnalytics`|_see example_|here's an opportunity to hook in whatever event tracking you have, (we use google analytics)|
|`helpMenuTitle`|`Search Help`|page and popup title displayed at the top of the menu (useful for translations) |
|`helpMenuWidth`|`500` (px)|the width of the dialog box and associated popup|
|`enableNotificationIndicator`|`false`|visually highlight the top-bar icon for new users until they open and dismiss it|
|`notificationIndicatorExpiration`|2 weeks|set the amount of time it takes before the notification dismissal resets|

## Events Logged

All events are logged under the category `help-menu`.

|action|label |description|
|:-----|:-----|:---------|
|`open-dialog`|_page user was on when clicked_|user clicks on the icon in the top right to initially open help-menu|
|`select-item`|_`item.id` of currently open entry or webpage_|user selects an item in the main help-menu or follows link to another entry|
|`open-window`|_`item.id` of currently open entry or webpage_|user presses 'open in new window' button|

_note: At BU Libraries, we use Google Analytics to track and log events. Given this, all events emitted follow the  'category > action > label' convention._
